# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Swish is a Clojure-like Lisp implementation designed to integrate seamlessly with Swift and the Apple developer ecosystem. The goal is to bring Clojure's powerful features (persistent data structures, functional programming idioms, homoiconicity, macros) to iOS, macOS, and other Apple platforms.

## Code Style

See [swift.md](swift.md) for Swift and SwiftUI coding guidelines, including modern API usage, concurrency patterns, and SwiftData requirements.

## Build Commands

*To be added once the project structure is created.*

## Architecture

*To be documented as the codebase develops.*
